Today Iâ€™ve watched a video about the invention and the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and I would like to discuss a little bit about it. IoT refers to the Internet of things (IoT) through various devices and technologies such as information sensors, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, global positioning system (GPS), infrared sensors, laser scanners, etc, to realize the intelligent perception, recognition, and management of goods and the process of devices connect with IoT. The Internet of things (IoT) is an information carrier based on the Internet and traditional telecommunication network. It enables all ordinary physical objects that can be independently addressed to form an interconnected network, that is, to connect all things together through the Internet. Some of the application of IoT includes Smart Home, Wearable IoT devices, Smart Car, Smart Manufacturing, and Smart City.

Smart Home: Smart home technology, also often referred to as home automation, provides homeowners security, comfort, convenience, and energy efficiency by allowing them to control smart devices, often by a smart home app on their smartphone or other networked devices. A part of the internet of things (IoT), smart home systems, and devices often operate together, sharing consumer usage data among themselves and automating actions based on the homeowners' preferences.

Wearable IoT devices: Wearable IoT devices, namely smartwatches and fitness trackers, are among the most conspicuous examples of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Wearables are used primarily for singular functions such as checking the time and tracking exercise.
Smart Car: Many of the cars are now connected to the Internet. The emergence of the Internet of things has transformed the automotive industry and led to the integration of the many application, such as application for navigation, diagnostic tools, in-car entertainment, and even self-driving cars.

Smart Manufacturing: In the manufacturing industry, industrial Internet and smart manufacturing have brought about the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry around the world. In particular, the deployment of industrial robots has become the direction of many large-scale manufacturing industries. The use of machines to replace dangerous, simple, and repetitive work has been widely used in major production bases around the world.

Smart City: The Internet of things technology has ushered in a new era of smart cities, from smart cameras to the deployment of various sensors to collect all kinds of data about the city, and after processing by cloud AI technology, it can help improve the capacity of urban public management, such as traffic and streets. More and more cities around the world are embracing the Internet of things as a way to improve their ability to fine manage cities.
